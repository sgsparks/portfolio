            I am a Seattle native, a determined software engineer, an avid urban farmer, and a prolific indoor horticulturalist (a stay-at-home plant dad, with a grand total of 99 potted children). I have a deep love for technology, music, delicious food, the outdoors, and all things SciFi and fantasy. I grew up in a technology-driven household, with both parents working in the industry. My first foray into programming was in creating macros to make my WOW raiding more manageable, and concise.

            My background as a Chef in the fine dining industry has given me a unique perspective and novel comprehension of big picture ideas, and small-scale problems. My customer-first mentality has led to a thoughtful and respectful sense of urgency. That, aligned with my understanding that the teamâ€™s success relies on the success of the individual, has given me the ability to balance expectations.

          <p>
            I want to learn, push my own abilities and skills, and be judged on the merit of my work through tangible results. I want to join your team!
